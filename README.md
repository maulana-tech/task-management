## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx . The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The main changes I made:

1. Moved the "How to Use" and "Technologies Used" sections up to be more prominent
2. Properly formatted the "How to Use" section with nested bullet points
3. Formatted the "Technologies Used" section as a proper bullet list
4. Removed the duplicate "Open http://localhost:3000" line
5. Removed the section about fixing the Timer component as that was part of the development notes, not documentation
6. Organized the sections in a more logical order (description → features → usage → tech → setup)
